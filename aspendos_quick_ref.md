# ASPENDOS QUICK-START REFERENCE

*One-page summary of everything you need to know for launch*

## THE PITCH (30 seconds)

**Aspendos is the AI operating system.** 

50+ premium models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, open-source), persistent memory across all of them, multi-model synthesis, agentic automation â€” all in one interface.

Instead of paying $60-200/month scattered across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, you get everything for **$49 PRO or $129 ULTRA**.

The key differentiator: **Memory**. Your conversations, preferences, and insights persist across chats and models. You control what gets remembered.

## OBJECTION HANDLERS (The 5 You'll Get Asked)

**Q: Why not just use ChatGPT Plus for $20?**  
A: "ChatGPT is 1 model with no memory. Aspendos is 50+ models with memory that persists across them + multi-model synthesis. You're paying $20 for 1 thing, $49 for everything."

**Q: This seems expensive.**  
A: "You're currently paying $60+ for ChatGPT + Claude + Gemini separate, no memory, fragmented. Aspendos is $49 all-in. If it saves 2 hours/week, that's 10x ROI."

**Q: Why is ULTRA $129?**  
A: "You're consolidating $300+ in tools (ChatGPT Pro, Lovable, Kling video, etc.). ULTRA gives you multi-model synthesis, video gen, rapid prototyping. It's 40% of what you're paying now for more features."

**Q: Will you lock me in?**  
A: "No. Full data export, anytime. Bring your ChatGPT/Claude conversations. You can leave tomorrow with everything."

**Q: What about data privacy?**  
A: "End-to-end encrypted. We don't train models on your data. Never sell it. Clear policy, coming soon: SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA certifications."

## KEY ASSUMPTIONS & RISKS

**Assumption 1:** Users will value memory at $49+ price point  
**Risk:** If memory adoption is <40%, pricing wrong  
**Mitigation:** A/B test $39 price if needed by Week 4

**Assumption 2:** Model API costs stay predictable  
**Risk:** OpenAI/Anthropic raise prices significantly  
**Mitigation:** Build open-source model routing to reduce cost exposure

**Assumption 3:** Multi-model adds 10%+ premium  
**Risk:** Users only want one model (unlikely but possible)  
**Mitigation:** If <30% use multi-model feature, reconsider ULTRA positioning

**Assumption 4:** Enterprise tier viable with compliance  
**Risk:** SOC 2/GDPR take longer than expected  
**Mitigation:** Start enterprise outreach in May, pilot Q3 2026

**Assumption 5:** No major competitor launches similar product  
**Risk:** OpenAI/Anthropic launch own "memory + multi-model" tier  
**Mitigation:** Move fast, lock in early users with strong product experience

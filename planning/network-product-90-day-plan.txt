Yula 90-Day Network + Habit Plan

Goal
- Find and scale a repeatable atomic network.
- Increase weekly retention with Trigger-Action-Reward-Investment loops.
- Protect quality while growing.

North Star
- Weekly retained teams (teams with >=3 active users/week and >=5 shared interactions/week)

Core Metrics
- Atomic network activation rate (new teams reaching first value in 24h)
- Hard-side retention (4-week retention of power users: PM/lead/power contributor)
- Network density (team-level interactions per active user)
- TARI completion rate (triggered flow completion)
- Time-to-first-value (signup -> first successful outcome)
- Route performance SLO (dev compile times for critical routes)

Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Atomic Network
- Target segment: 5-12 person product/engineering teams.
- Primary use case: decision logging + follow-up execution from AI chat context.
- Hard side focus: PM/tech lead/power user who produces reusable context.
- Product tasks:
  - One-click decision card from chat.
  - Follow-up scheduling from decision card.
  - Team-visible decision timeline.
- GTM tasks:
  - 10 pilot teams.
  - Concierge onboarding for first 3 sessions/team.
- Exit criteria:
  - >=40% pilot teams hit activation in 24h.
  - >=60% hard-side users active in week 4.

Phase 2 (Days 31-60): Tipping Point Mechanics
- Trigger:
  - Post-meeting prompt and digest reminders.
- Action:
  - 1-click convert suggestion to task/follow-up.
- Variable Reward:
  - Better summaries and recommendations from accumulated context.
- Investment:
  - Stored decisions, history imports, personalized memory quality gains.
- Product tasks:
  - Digest quality scoring + feedback loop.
  - Import flow hardening for ChatGPT/Claude history.
  - Shared memory highlights for teams.
- Exit criteria:
  - >=30% increase in weekly retained teams vs phase start.
  - >=25% improvement in TARI completion.

Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Escape Velocity Readiness
- Growth loops:
  - Team invites from shared outcomes (not generic invites).
  - Cross-team templates for decision workflows.
- Ceiling defenses:
  - Overcrowding: better search, tagging, and feed ranking.
  - Hard-side revolt: power-user controls, visibility, credit.
  - Quality drift: stricter onboarding defaults + curation.
- Product tasks:
  - Workspace discovery improvements.
  - Quality guardrails for noisy content.
  - Retention win-back flows for churned teams.
- Exit criteria:
  - 2 repeatable acquisition channels with measurable CAC/LTV profile.
  - Plateau response playbook defined and tested.

Weekly Operating Cadence
- Monday: metric review + bottleneck selection.
- Tuesday-Wednesday: ship 1 growth experiment + 1 retention experiment.
- Thursday: pilot interviews (at least 5 users, hard side weighted).
- Friday: retro with keep/kill/iterate decisions.

Immediate Backlog (this week)
- Finalize atomic network ICP and pilot list.
- Instrument metrics for activation, hard-side retention, density.
- Ship onboarding flow for first-value in under 15 minutes.
- Launch 2 trigger experiments:
  - Meeting-end decision capture prompt.
  - 24h follow-up reminder with one-click action.
